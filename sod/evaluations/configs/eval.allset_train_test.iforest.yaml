# the output director root path. The output path will be constructed by
# appending the basename of the input file above to the root path:
# <output>/basename(<input>) (the directory will be created if non existing)
# Therein, for any combination of features and parameters three files will be stored:
# 1. An hdf file with all predictions (same length, in principle, of the input dataframe):
# - <clf>?features=<features>&params=<params>.evalpredictions.hdf
# 2. An HTML file with all confusion matrices (one per feature set, the scores of 
# all parameters combinations are stored in the html):
# - <clf>?features=<features>.evalreport.html
# The model (scikit dumped model) for the given features and parameters (using
# all instances in the set, which depends on the clf implementation, i.e.
# for OneClassSVM 'all instances' means good segments only. See `execute.EVALUATORS`
# for details):
# - <clf>?features=<features>&params=<params>.model
